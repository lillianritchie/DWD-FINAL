# Lillian's To Do List: DWD Week 5
<!-- A one sentence description of the project or assignment -->
This is my fifth week's homework assignment for Dynamic Web Dev. 


<!-- It is good practice to add an about or summary -->
## About

For this assignment, we were asked to connect the database we built in class to client side javascript that would enable us to update our database in the DOM.

<!-- It is essential to describe how to set up your project -->
## Setup

This project requires node.js, express, and mongoose.

<!-- Any knowledge or tools you will need before hand -->
### Prerequisites

1. A text editor - preferably [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. An understanding of markdown syntax. You can learn about markdown at this [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
3. node.js, express, and mongoose


<!-- any installation needs should be defined -->
### Installation

Youll need to install node, mongoose, and express.

<!-- Write instructions on how to start working on your project -->

# Notes, Process, and Documentation
* This week we were given the option of starting a new database from scratch, or building from the one we started in class. I chose to start with the existing database so that I could practice my client side js, and I'm glad I did, because I ran into a lot of unexpected issues and learned a lot.
* My initial plan was to go back and start my own database from scratch once I finished the client side portion of the project, but as is tradition, I took a lot longer to  finish this than I anticipated, and probably wont be able to start my new database until tomorrow AM (who knows?! maybe I'll still have somethign to show for class??)



<!-- Any specific challenges or struggles documented -->
## Challenges & Struggles
* One major struggle I've been dealing with since last week is keeping track of the "spaghetti" tangle that is all of the information being sent in different directions and between several files. After meeting with Joey, I decided to take his suggestion of structuring my client side code as a class. I worked off of [his example](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/joeyklee-todo-app-mongodb?path=README.md:1:0) and between restructuring my code and referring to his when something in mine broke, I think I'm FINALLY coming to terms with what information gets sent where, and why.
* Last week was really tough for me, because I felt like I didn't understand enough of what I was coding to be able to google my own answers. This week, I felt like I made a huge step forward in being able to phrase my questions in a way where I could google them and figure out what my problems are. It didnt happen until sunday afternoon, but once it did click it felt.... GREAT.

<!-- Any questions you have -->
## Questions
* Can I make up any name I want for an html attribute? I found myself putting data inside my html tags with crazy attribute names and it seemed to work, but I did notice that attribute names with a dash in them didn't work when I tried to call on them in js. What's the logic behind attribute naming and what you can/can't use?
