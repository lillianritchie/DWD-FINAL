# Lillian's To Do List: DWD Final Project
<!-- A one sentence description of the project or assignment -->
This is my final project for Dynamic Web Dev. 


<!-- It is good practice to add an about or summary -->
## About

For this assignment, we were asked to incorporate all the skills we covered in this class, using HTML, CSS, client-side javascript, server side javascript, and connecting to an API using MongoDB.  I decided to use this project to get started designing my thesis website, and so built a comment board for users to post messages that live on that part of the site. 

<!-- It is essential to describe how to set up your project -->
## Setup

This project requires node.js, express, and mongoose. To run the project on your machine:
* download all files and navigate to the project location in your terminal
* create a .env file to store the mongo uri (you'll have to contact me for this or create your own)
* run npm install to download any dependencies
* run npm start to run the project on a local server.

<!-- Any knowledge or tools you will need before hand -->
### Prerequisites

1. A text editor - preferably [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. An understanding of markdown syntax. You can learn about markdown at this [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
3. node.js, express, sass, and mongoose


<!-- any installation needs should be defined -->
### Installation

Youll need to install node, mongoose, and express. Sass shouldn't be necessary as i've already used it to compile the CSS.

# Notes, Process, and Documentation
* I started this project by sketching out some basic ideas and collecting come color schemes using [adobe color](https://color.adobe.com/create) and google fonts.
* Next, I made myself a little "styleguide" in figma:

* Then I worked out a basic design for what i'd like things to look like (still in figma)

* While working on these aspects, I was working my way through the first portion of [this udemy course on css](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/learn/lecture/8274490#overview)

* I started the project by working out all of the html and css for the page

* Then, I used Joey and Cassie's guides to walk myself through setting up a new mongoDB project and cluster for this project.

* I chose to only code front end for ADDING comments, because I didn't want my users to delete each other's comments or questions. However, I did code in the ability to PUT and DELETE manually from postman, so that I can moderate content myself.


<!-- Any specific challenges or struggles documented -->
## Challenges & Struggles
* COVID-19 was my primary struggle this time around. While on break, I had to move apartments and lost a lot of work time to the re-shuffle. Joey was kind enough to give me some extra time to finish up my work, so thank you again!
